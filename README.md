# WatchWomensSportsHub
## Problem Statement

Women’s sports are becoming increasingly popular events to watch. However in the media, female sporting events are not given the same amount of attention as male sporting events. With rising stars like Caitlin Clark, Simone Biles, and Coco Gauff, young women are gaining more and more interest in watching women’s sports.

Since women’s sports are not highlighted in the media as prominently as men’s sports, it’s hard for new viewers to find when and where women’s games are held. The spectator who does not know where or how to find game information will rarely be able to watch a live game when it is televised. Even further, without reminders of play dates and times, it is near impossible for an untrained fan to support their team.

## Technical Solution 

Create an application that tracks when, and hopefully where, women’s sporting events are being televised. Watch Women’s Sports Hub will be a one stop shop for women’s sports whether it is a pro or college event. It will also have functionality for users to have favorite teams and players. The app will also remind users when their favorite teams and players are playing. 

### Scenario 1

Ella saw a TikTok of Cailtyn Clark and wants to watch her next basketball game. She doesn’t know where to look to find it and knows she will forget about it by the time it’s played. She logs onto the Watch Women’s Sports hub where she finds Caitlyn and adds her as a favorite player. The next Indiana Fever game is in four days, and on the day of, Ella is sent a reminder the game is at 6:30 pm. She watches the entire game and looks forward to the next. 

### Scenario 2

During the Olympics, Abbey loved watching volleyball and she kept up watching some pro matches. Now that college volleyball season is starting up, she wants to tune into the collegiate matches as well. Abbey already uses the Watch Women’s Sports Hub, so she adds some of the top NCAA volleyball teams to her favorites. Now she only has to go to one place to find the pro and collegiate sports she wants to watch.
